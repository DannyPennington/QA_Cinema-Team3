Team 3's cinema project

Our key working points:
3 Day sprints <br />
Stay in call all day but muted, be available for discussion. Standups in morning and after lunch <br />
Have 2 people working on similar projects, helping each other if/when needed. Code reviews to be done by other person and a person not in the pair. <br />
Be sensible, names should describe what a variable is without being too long
